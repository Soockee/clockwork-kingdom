# Clockwork Kingdom

Game Genre: Puzzle Platformer

Clockwork Kingdom is a 2D puzzle platformer set in a mechanical world where time and machinery rule the land.
Players control a small robot protagonist, Cog, as it explores the Clockwork Kingdom to restore the flow of time and bring life back to the dormant machines.

## Core Game Mechanics

### Time Manipulation 
Cog has the ability to manipulate time within a small radius.
Players can use this power to solve puzzles, avoid obstacles, or freeze certain elements in the environment.
This mechanic adds a layer of strategy and experimentation to the gameplay.

### Gears and Levers: 
The levels are filled with gears and levers that players must interact with to progress.
These elements can be moved, rotated, or activated to create new paths, unlock hidden areas, or reveal items.

### Cog Upgrades 
As players progress through the game, they can find and collect various upgrade items to enhance Cog's abilities.
These upgrades may include improved time manipulation, increased speed or jump height, and new abilities such as wall climbing or a grappling hook.

### Physics-based Puzzles
Levels contain various physics-based puzzles that require players to use Cog's abilities and the environment to progress.
These puzzles may include moving platforms, weighted objects, or elements affected by time manipulation.

### Unique Boss Encounters
The Clockwork Kingdom contains several boss encounters, each with their own unique mechanics and strategies.
Players must use their time manipulation abilities and other learned skills to defeat these bosses and restore the flow of time.

## Visual Style 
The game's visuals should be inspired by a blend of steampunk and mechanical aesthetics, with intricate gears and machinery as the dominant theme.
Levels can be set in various environments, such as clock towers, abandoned factories, and underground tunnels.
The color palette can consist of muted browns, brass, and copper tones, accented by glowing clockwork elements.
