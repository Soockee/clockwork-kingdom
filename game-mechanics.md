# Game Mechanics

##  Time Manipulation
Time manipulation allows Cog to control the flow of time within a limited area.  

1.  Activation: Time manipulation can be activated by pressing a specific input on the controller or keyboard (e.g., holding down the right mouse button or a designated key). This input should be easily accessible and comfortable for the player to use.
    
2.  Time Manipulation Radius: When Cog activates time manipulation, a circular area around him will be affected. This area, or "time bubble," should be visually distinct, perhaps by using a transparent overlay or a glowing border. The size of the time bubble can be fixed or adjustable, depending on the desired level of complexity and challenge.
    
3.  Time Manipulation Modes: Cog can manipulate time in several ways within the time bubble, such as:
    
    a. Slowing down time: Objects and characters within the bubble, including Cog, move at a slower pace, allowing the player to react more easily to fast-moving obstacles or enemies.
    
    b. Speeding up time: Objects and characters within the bubble move faster, potentially used to speed up slow-moving mechanisms or solve time-based puzzles.
    
    c. Freezing time: Time comes to a complete stop within the bubble, freezing objects and characters in place. This can be useful for creating temporary platforms, stopping hazards, or immobilizing enemies.
    
    d. Reversing time: Time flows backward within the bubble, undoing recent actions or returning objects and characters to their previous states. This can help players correct mistakes or explore alternative solutions to puzzles.
    
4.  Energy and Duration: Time manipulation can be limited by an energy meter that depletes as Cog uses his abilities. The energy meter can slowly regenerate over time or be replenished by collecting power-ups. To balance the gameplay, the duration of time manipulation can be limited, requiring players to strategically use the ability to solve puzzles and overcome challenges.
    
5.  Upgrades and Progression: As players progress through the game, Cog can acquire upgrades that enhance his time manipulation abilities. These upgrades could include increasing the time manipulation radius, improving energy efficiency, or unlocking new time manipulation modes.
    
6.  Integration with Other Mechanics: Time manipulation should be integrated seamlessly with the game's other core mechanics, such as gear and lever interactions, Cog upgrades, and physics-based puzzles. Players should be encouraged to experiment with time manipulation and combine it with other abilities to overcome challenges and explore the game world.


## Gear and lever interactions 

Gear and lever interactions allows the  player to interact with the game world's intricate machinery and solve puzzles.

1. Interaction Points: Throughout the game, players will encounter gears and levers that are designed as interaction points. These elements should be visually distinct, signaling to the player that they can be manipulated. You may choose to use a glowing outline, unique color, or animated indicator to highlight these interaction points.

2.  Activation: To interact with a gear or lever, the player must approach it and press a specific input on the controller or keyboard (e.g., the 'E' key or a designated button). This action should be context-sensitive, meaning that the input will only activate the gear or lever when Cog is in close proximity to the interaction point.

3. Gear Interactions: Gears can be manipulated in various ways, depending on their design and function within the game world. Some possible interactions include:

    a. Rotating gears: Players can rotate gears either clockwise or counterclockwise to change the orientation of connected machinery. This can be useful for aligning platforms, opening doors, or moving objects within the environment.

    b. Connecting gears: Players may need to find and attach gears to specific sockets to complete a mechanism, similar to a jigsaw puzzle. This can involve locating missing gears within the level or obtaining them as rewards for solving other puzzles.

    c. Speed control: In some instances, players may need to adjust the speed at which gears rotate, either by interacting directly with the gear or by manipulating a connected lever or control panel. This can impact the movement of platforms, doors, or other mechanical elements.

    Lever Interactions: Levers can be used to control various aspects of the game world's machinery. Possible lever interactions include:

    a. Switching states: Levers can be toggled between two or more states, such as 'on' and 'off' or 'up' and 'down.' This can be used to activate or deactivate machinery, change the direction of moving platforms, or control the flow of energy within a system.

    b. Sliders and dials: Some levers may function as sliders or dials, allowing players to make more precise adjustments to machinery, such as changing the speed of gears or raising and lowering platforms to specific heights.

    c. Sequence puzzles: In certain cases, players may need to activate levers in a specific sequence or combination to solve a puzzle. This can involve memorizing patterns, deciphering clues, or experimenting through trial and error.

4. Puzzle Design: Gear and lever interactions should be integrated into a variety of puzzles and challenges throughout Clockwork Kingdom. These puzzles should be designed to test the player's logical thinking, spatial awareness, and problem-solving skills. As the game progresses, the complexity of these puzzles should gradually increase, encouraging players to master the gear and lever interaction mechanic and think creatively.


## Cog Upgrades
Cog Upgrades allows the player  to enhance the protagonist's abilities and skills over time.
This mechanic provides a sense of progression and encourages players to explore the game world in search of upgrade opportunities.

1.  Upgrade Types: 
Throughout the game, players can find or earn various types of upgrades for Cog.
These upgrades can fall into several categories, such as:
    
    a. Mobility upgrades: Enhance Cog's movement abilities, such as increased speed, double jump, wall climbing, or a grappling hook.
    
    b. Time manipulation upgrades: Improve Cog's time manipulation abilities, such as extending the duration or radius of the time bubble, increasing energy efficiency, or unlocking new time manipulation modes.
    
    c. Combat upgrades: If combat is a part of the game, provide Cog with new attack moves, increased damage, or defensive abilities.
    
    d. Utility upgrades: Grant Cog new tools or skills that help solve puzzles or interact with the environment, such as the ability to move heavy objects, manipulate magnetic surfaces, or see hidden paths.
    
2.  Acquisition: Upgrades can be acquired in various ways, such as:
    
    a. Exploration rewards: Encourage players to explore the game world by hiding upgrades in secret areas, challenging platforming sections, or optional side quests.
    
    b. Story progression: Grant upgrades as a natural part of the story, often as rewards for completing significant milestones or defeating bosses.
    
    c. In-game currency or resources: Allow players to collect in-game currency or resources that can be used to purchase or craft upgrades from vendors, workshops, or other points of interest.
    
3.  Upgrade System: Design an intuitive and user-friendly upgrade system that allows players to manage and applytheir upgrades.
This system can be accessed through an in-game menu, a dedicated upgrade station, or a combination of both.
Players should be able to view their current upgrades, read descriptions of their effects, and equip or unequip them as desired.
    
4.  Balancing and Progression: Ensure that the upgrade system is balanced and well-paced, providing players with a steady sense of progression without making Cog overpowered.
Upgrades should be introduced gradually, allowing players to master new abilities and adjust to the increasing complexity of the game's challenges.
    
5.  Replayability and Customization: Offering a variety of upgrades with different effects can encourage replayability and allow players to customize Cog to suit their preferred playstyle.
Players may choose to focus on mobility upgrades for a fast-paced, agile approach, or invest in time manipulation upgrades for a more strategic, puzzle-solving experience.
